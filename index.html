The trip took place in 3 stages, 4 days in Bangkok, the capital, then a week in Chiang Mai, and finally, a week on an island; Koh Samui."

<h2>1. Bangkok </h2>

	    <img src="images/bangkok.jpeg" alt="Chiang Mai" width="500px">
	    <p> My first destination was Bangkok, the capital of Thaïland. My family and I were staying in a house named "the anonymous house", it was so beautiful and the people were so welcoming! I really enjoyed the city with its small alleys, its markets, its street kitchens, its boat-buses on the river Chao Phraya, but I think 3 days are enough to visit the city. In fact, there are many tourists and the city is very polluted (I would advise you to bring some masks). One of our best memories was our gondola ride on the river, even if it was expensive, I recommend it.

<h2>2. Chiang Mai</h2>

	    <p>Then we went to Chiang Mai by plane (you can also get there by train). This town was smaller but really great. Its proximity to the jungle allowed us to spend some times among the elephants in the "Elephant Jungle Sanctuary". It was unforgettable. However, be careful not to go to elephant sanctuaries where they are abused, make sure that they are never ridden by tourists or tied up. Where we went, it was a sanctuary for old abused elephants, they left them a lot of freedom. I really advise you to go there and especially to sleep there, it's fabulous.</p>

        <h2>3. Koh Samui</h2>

	    <img src="images/kohsamui.png" alt="Chiang Mai" width="500px">
	    <p> Finally we flew to spend a week on an island: Koh Samui. We stayed at the Health Oasis Resort, it was expensive but really clean, beautiful and luxurious. On this island, I recommend activities such as jet skiing, testing the many sandy beaches, or even testing the famous "mango sticky rice" dessert in the many restaurants. I also advise you to eat at the restaurant "Treehouse silent beach", it is an excellent place not to be missed. Finally we recommend you to spend a day on a boat that will take you to the small islands close to Koh Samui like Ko Mae Ko. There are magnificent landscapes, breathtaking, and you can dive there too.</p>
